# 11/27 Approximating_function

Let user arbitrary clink six points with order and connect these six points with straight line. Find a polynomial so that the polynomial is close to the line of those six points.

1. Add more points between two points
2.  Use `polyfit` to find the polynomial that fit these points

**Result:**

(In the code I use the polynomial of 5-degree to fit the line, maybe use higher degree it will fit more explicitly)
